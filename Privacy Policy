Privacy Policy for AI ChatWorks
Last Updated: October 7, 2025

Thank you for using AI ChatWorks ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we handle your data.

1. No Data Collection
AI ChatWorks is designed with your privacy as its top priority. We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data.

2. Local Storage
All data related to the Extension, including your saved prompts, folders, and settings, is stored exclusively on your local computer using your browser's built-in storage (chrome.storage.local and chrome.storage.sync).

Your prompts and folders never leave your machine. They are not sent to any external server or third-party service.

Your settings are synced across your devices only if you are signed into your browser and have enabled sync. This is a feature of the browser itself, and we have no access to this data.

3. Permissions
The Extension requests a minimum set of permissions required for its functionality:

storage: To save your prompts and settings locally on your device.

activeTab / scripting: To inject the user interface (the side panel and modals) into the supported chat websites (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini). The extension only runs on these specific sites.

tabs: To manage extension functionality when you switch between tabs or open new ones on supported sites.

The Extension does not read, monitor, or access any information from your web pages other than what is necessary to inject its UI and apply text-direction styling.

4. Third-Party Services
AI ChatWorks does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version number and date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
